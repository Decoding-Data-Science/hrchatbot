# Confidentiality Agreements and NDAs

 - If clients ask about whether our team are covered by confidentiality agreements, we can let them know that all employees sign **Terms and Conditions of Employment** which include clauses for confidentiality and intellectual property.
 - Company Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAâ€™s) are included in contracts raised with contractors. A template for our NDA can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YESByvaOv06azyq6JTNqmD9vsHh224lQ9urKV0p4_pY/edit)
 - If you are looking to record or take photos of our team for any purpose, please remember that no recording equipment may be used in internal, supplier, or customer meetings without the **knowledge and consent** of all those present in the meetings
